# Fast-Java-Offscreen-Drawing
A small library which provides fast 2d offscreen rendering for Java. Up to 50x faster than a BufferedImage. This library is experimental and is intended for personal use. 

This library is free for anyone to use, and I'll appreciate it if you get in touch if you wish to use this in your project.
